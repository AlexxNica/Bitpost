todo

[adam]
- alphabetically sort identities, channels, subscriptions


- filter BMReceivedMessages into channels and subscriptions
  - if TO field is in identities -> receviedMessages children
  - if TO field is in channels -> channels children
  - if TO field is in subscriptions -> subscriptions children


should inbox be separated from received messages?

- deal with deleted or read messages reappearing - add db

- select item after add/update

- compose button/menu

- auto refresh table reload?
- keyboard shortcuts (delete to delete message) - generic with actions?

- fix selection after reload (stay on same message if possible, not row index)

- use address labels in compose & autocomplete

- find

- red tag on app icon for unread count

- open draft windows in proper place (stack them?)

- Objc wrapper on callsystem.c to fork, setgrp and exec server


- menus?

- possible ref loop with node and BMMessageView?

- cleanup base64 in dicts

- back arrow to navigate

- after a item remove, nav to prev column if column is empty

- avoid contact update on label or address change until done editing
